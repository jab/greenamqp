Python AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) Client library

This is a version of py-amqplib with modifications for use with eventlet.
These changes allow concurrent use of independent channels on a single 
connection by multiple eventlets.  The py-amqplib api is unchanged and 
can be used as normal.
